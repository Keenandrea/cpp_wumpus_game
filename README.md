# cpp_wumpus_game

DESCRIPTION
The Wumpus Game is a console application written 
in the C++ coding language using Microsoft Visual
Studio as an IDE. The game is played by one play-
er, who can traverse the gameboard in compass co-
ordinates (i.e. left, right, forward, backward).
The objective of the game is to find the treasure
hidden on the gameboard while avoiding danger, by
which I mean a number of pits, selected at random
and dropped at random on the map, as well as a W-
umpus, the antagonist of the game. 

GETTING STARTED
To initiate the program on your machine, a version
of Visual Studio 2017 is required. This can be do-
wnloaded for free at: visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Once downloaded, begin a new C++ project and cont-
aining three files: 1) YourFileName.h; 2) YourFile
Name1.cpp; 3) YourFileName2.cpp. Copy and paste s-
ource code from GameWorld.h into your .h file. And
follow the same with the two remaining .cpp files.


RUNNING TESTS
To run automated tests on the program, look for t-
he Dropdown Menu at the top of your Visual Studio
IDE labeled Test or Debug.

DEPLOYMENT
Within the Visual Studio IDE, build and run the p-
rogram. It will run as a console application.
